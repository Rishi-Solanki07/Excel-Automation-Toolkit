# Excel Data Splitter Tool

Automatically splits large Excel data into multiple Excel files based on any selected column.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement
In many business Excel files, data is stored in a single sheet containing:
- Multiple columns
- Thousands of rows
- Information for multiple people (e.g., salespersons)

Often, there is a requirement to create **separate Excel files** for each person.  
Doing this manually requires filtering, copying, and saving data multiple times, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

The **Excel Data Splitter Tool** automates this process.

It:
- Reads data from any Excel sheet
- Splits data based on a selected column
- Automatically creates separate Excel files
- Saves each file to a selected folder
